# Emeth
![](./setup/Emeth_Schema.excalidraw)
Emeth, meaning 'truth' in Hebrew, is a revolutionary Know Your Customer (KYC) system built to run as a full node across multiple blockchain networks, including Ethereum, StarkNet, and Polygon. Developed with large institutions in mind, Emet is designed to provide a comprehensive, secure, and user-friendly KYC process for blockchain transactions. Our unique approach integrates the principles of decentralization and autonomy, focusing particularly on promoting the decentralization of RPC (Remote Procedure Call).

## Advantages of Emeth

Emeth's full node KYC system boasts a multitude of benefits, key among them being:

1. **Decentralization:** Emeth is built on the core principle of decentralization. By decentralizing RPC, Emeth reduces the dependency on centralized systems, thereby enhancing security, improving reliability, and increasing system resilience to faults and failures.

2. **Multi-chain Support:** Emet's design enables support for multiple chains. This unique feature offers institutions unparalleled flexibility by allowing them to operate seamlessly across different blockchains based on their specific requirements and preferences.

3. **Enhanced Security:** Emeth's KYC system significantly improves security by verifying the identities of individuals participating in a transaction. This stringent verification process minimizes the risk of fraudulent activities, ensuring that each transaction is legitimate and secure.

4. **Regulatory Compliance:** KYC procedures are vital for institutions to achieve regulatory compliance. Emeth simplifies this process by integrating KYC procedures into the blockchain transaction process, ensuring that your institution remains compliant with all relevant regulations.

5. **Trust and Transparency:** Emeth fosters trust among its users by verifying the identities of all parties involved in a transaction. This verification process not only builds trust but also enhances the overall transparency of blockchain transactions, making Emeth a reliable choice for all users.
